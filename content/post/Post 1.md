- Title: Predicting food demand in food courts by decision tree approaches


This week I found another article related to my research. The paper is about predicting food demand in food courts by decision tree approaches. From an economic point of view, preparing the wrong amount of food creates economic problems. If the supply exceeds the demand it leads to food waste and companies that make food lose their money and resources. On the other hand, if the demand is higher than the supply of food, the restaurant may lose their customer and prestige. Having a computer program that can predict the amount of food can benefit food suppliers in many ways. The research uses data mining and tree decision methods to predict the demand for food. Data mining is discovering the relationship, correlations, and trends in data with the help of algorithms. Data mining consists of various techniques such as neural networks, statistics, decision trees, and genetic algorithms. In the research, to study food demand the researchers collected the input data such as seasonal demand change, holidays along with the number of food consumed each day. Three different decision tree algorithms (CART, CHAID, and Mircosoft Decision Trees) are implemented to predict menu-based food consumption in a university food court. The decision tree is a data mining technique usually used for classification and prediction. The authors choose a decision tree in their research because it is an easily understandable and interpretable model, quick to build, and adaptable to data change. Moreover, decision tree methods also have high precision accuracy, so it is a trustable choice for this project. The main two tools they used in this project are SPSS Clementine and Microsoft Analysis Service.
