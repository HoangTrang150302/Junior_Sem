# Autobiography

Hi, my name is Trang Hoang and I am majoring in Computer Science. I am a transfer student. During my time studying computer science, the courses that attract me the most are software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and probabilities and statistics. These courses help me have a basic foundation of the software development industry, and from there I can build my projects. I know some programming languages like Java, C++, and Python. Data Science, Web development, and Software Engineering are some fields in Computer Science that Iâ€™m interested in.
